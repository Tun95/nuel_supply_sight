## 📋 Core Requirements Implemented
### ✅ Dashboard Layout
- Top navigation bar with SupplySight logo
- Date range selector (7d/14d/30d chips)
- KPI cards showing Total Stock, Total Demand, and Fill Rate
- Interactive line chart showing Stock vs Demand trends

### ✅ Data Visualization
- Real-time KPI calculations:
- - Total Stock: Sum of all product stock
- - Total Demand: Sum of all product demand
- - Fill Rate: (sum(min(stock, demand)) / sum(demand)) * 100%
- Dynamic line chart that updates with date range selection

### ✅ Filter System
- Search functionality (filters by name, SKU, and ID)
- Warehouse dropdown filter (populated from mock data)
- Status dropdown filter (All/Healthy/Low/Critical)

### ✅ Products Table
- Complete table with columns: Product, SKU, Warehouse, Stock, Demand, Status
- Status indicators with color coding:

- - 🟢 Healthy: stock > demand

- - 🟡 Low: stock = demand

- - 🔴 Critical: stock < demand (with row highlighting)

- Pagination system (10 rows per page)

### ✅ Interactive Features
- Real-time filter updates
- Row click interactions opening detail drawer
- Product detail sidebar with:
- - Complete product information
- - Update Demand mutation form
- - Transfer Stock mutation form

### ✅ GraphQL Implementation
- Mock Apollo Server setup
- Complete schema definition
- Query implementations for products, warehouses, and KPIs
- Mutation implementations for updateDemand and transferStock

## 🛠️ Technical Decisions & Trade-offs
### Architecture Choices
- React 18 with functional components and hooks for modern React patterns
- TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Apollo Client for GraphQL operations with built-in caching
- Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development and consistency
- Ant Design for reliable UI components (pagination)

### Mock Data Strategy
- Implemented in-memory mock resolvers instead of external API
- Trade-off: Faster development but would need migration for real backend
- Benefit: Demonstrates complete GraphQL understanding without backend dependency

### State Management
- Used React useState and useEffect for local state
- Leveraged Apollo Client cache for server state
- Benefit: Apollo cache provides sufficient state management for this scope

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with Tailwind's responsive utilities
- Trade-off: More complex CSS but better mobile experience
- Benefit: Single codebase for all device sizes

## ⏰ With More Time, I Would Improve
### Performance Optimizations
- Implement React.memo and useCallback for expensive components
- Add virtualization for large product lists
- Implement GraphQL query batching

### Testing
- Add comprehensive test suite (Jest + React Testing Library)
- GraphQL mock testing

### User Experience
- Loading skeletons for better perceived performance
- Undo/redo functionality for mutations
- Bulk operations for multiple products
- Data export capabilities (CSV/PDF)

### Advanced Features
- Real-time updates with GraphQL subscriptions
- User authentication and authorization
- Data persistence with local storage fallback
- Advanced analytics and forecasting
- Inventory alert system with notifications

### Production Readiness
- Error tracking (Sentry)
- Performance monitoring
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Environment-specific configurations

### Getting Started:
```
- locate the main directory
cd frontend_panel

- Install dependencies
npm install

- Start development server
npm run dev

- Build for production
npm run build
